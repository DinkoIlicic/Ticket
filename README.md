# CustomerTicket
Customer Ticket magento 2 extension


The extension needs to have following features:
  - Customer can submit support ticket from “My Account” section (needs to be logged in)
  - Customer can view his tickets in “My Account” (“My Tickets”)
  - Ticket needs to have Subject and Message
  - For every ticket, there could be multiple possible replies, from both admin and customer. For example: Customer submits a       ticket, admin replies,  Customer replies back, and so on
  - For html on My Account pages try using default Magento classes and element structure, most of elements are auto-styled that     way. Use Magento javascript validation.
  - Admin can see customer tickets from Magento administration and reply to them
  - Tickets are stored per website, per customer. 
  - Tickets can have status: open/closed. New ticket is automatically open. Both administrator or customer can close a ticket.

Additional:
  - Admin gets email on new ticket (configurable in Magento Administration). Implement as seperate module that depends on           Ticket module.
  - Implement up to two more features of your choice that you think would be usable on such extension.
